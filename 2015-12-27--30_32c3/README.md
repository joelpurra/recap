# [32nd Chaos Communication Congress (32c3)](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/)

*A collection of notes from 32c3 talks.*

2015-12-27--30. Hamburg, Germany.


> The [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) is an annual conference organized by the [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club). The congress features a variety of lectures and workshops on technical and political issues related to Security, Cryptography, Privacy and online Freedom of Speech. The event takes place regularly at the end of the year since 1984, with the current date and duration (December 27â€“30) established in 2005. It is considered one of the largest events of this kind, alongside the DEF CON in Las Vegas.


Circa [150 talks](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events.html) were given in the four main halls. They were recorded and [videos have been published](https://media.ccc.de/c/32c3). The technical depth of many talks is impressive; some of it is original research being presented for the first time. Browsing through the list of both 32c3, [earlier congresses](https://events.ccc.de/congress/) and the [media archive](https://media.ccc.de/) is highly recommended.
