## Talk notes

- Wassenaar agreement.
    - Initially written to limit exporting of physical weapons for armed conflicts.
    - Exporting "dual use" products is illegal.
    - 41 nations have signed (2012); EU countries and the US for example.
- 2013 revision added surveillance/intrusion software wordings.
    - Finalized but not yet implemented?
    - *Note: need to look up implementation status in EU/US?*
    - Security software can be "dual use".
        - Traveling with security software can be illegal.
        - Talking about security software can be illegal.
        - Talking about security software in the US with someone who lives in the EU can be illegal.
- Dual citizenships can potentially be a problem.
- Public domain is exempt (?) but the definition is unclear.
    - Open source isn't automatically in the public domain.
    - Code that hasn't been published/committed to a public repository is still private?
    - Preparing a talk on security outside of the EU may be illegal.
- The text has been in place since 2009 (?).
    - The drafting process wasn't open to the public
        - The text was known very late.
        - Had only a few weeks to organize complaints.
        - It was too late to have an effect on final text.
- It's unclear where lines are drawn.
    - Lots of things "may" require export regulations.
    - Teaching foreign students can be illegal; it can be a "tangible transfer" once the information is in the brains of the students.
    - When lawmakers and officials are asked, they say not to worry -- but they give no clear examples.
    - Pentesting and commercial systems hardening may be illegal, if it crosses a border in any way.
    - An innocent victim of malware crossing a border may be considered performing an illegal act (but there may be "intent" wording).
    - The code itself may not be subject to control, but the comments to the code *definitely* are.
    - Gray areas.
