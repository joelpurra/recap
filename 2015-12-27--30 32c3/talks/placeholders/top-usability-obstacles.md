# Top X* usability obstacles

*What do you want? Did you build your web/app for humans or NSA robots? Let's make it usable for human beings. I'd like to show you some basic design mistakes and how to avoid them to improve usability of your web or app. Why? Because it's worth it and I'm good in it.*
