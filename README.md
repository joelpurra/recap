Scribbled down while listening. Using hierarchical list format. Much is transcribed from presentation slides. Maybe fixed up afterwards. An actually summary if there's time. Probably don't make sense without watching the videos. Typos. Misunderstandings. Incomplete. Biased. Factually incorrect. Good to have.

Some talks only have placeholders. Would probably be nice to (re-)watch them later, perhaps even to take notes. See them as tips. Patches welcome.
