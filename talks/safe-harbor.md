  - EU countries, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Israel have "adequate protection" and data transfer is allowed from the EU.
  - No general data protection law in the US.
  - If US companies promises to follow the EU laws, they will be allowed to store information under the overlook of EU.
- Facebook.
  - Non-US/Canadian Facebook members have a contract with Facebook Ireland Ltd.
  - Data is transfered straight to the US servers.
  - EU laws says that forwarding data to the NSA isn't "adequate protection".
  - Facebook is subject to both US and EU law.
  - EU laws protect privacy and data, but allows FISA following a legal chain.
  - EU proportionality laws doesn't require proof, only that Facebook "makes data available".
    - PRISM slides mention Facebook, which proves that it's made available outside of the company.
    - US bill of rights only applies to US citizens.
    - Safe harbor principles do not apply if there's a law overriding it.
  - Procedure.
    - TRUSTe is doing arbitration, but it's "not in their power."
    - FCC says it's "not in their power".
    - Irish DPC said (RTE) that US companies "obviously" hand over data to the US intelligency agencies.
    - Irish DPC said it doesn't really matter (?).
    - Irish DPC says they don't _have_ to investigate, and that it might not be a _frivolous" claim.
    - Other cases in Luxemburg, Germany.
    - Irish high court Schrems vs DPC.
      - Costly if you lose the case, because you have to pay the costs.
      - Case has to be brought to the court physically at a certain time and day.
      - irish juridicial system uses paper, and this case had thousands.
      - The court doesn't allow the claimant to talk to the judge -- only through two other representatives/lawyers (?).
      - The Irish court made a question to the EU commission.
      - Irish court deemed everything said about PRISM is true, based on slides.
      - Protective cost order set a max limit of the costs of the EU procedures in CJEU.
    - Ended up in the highest level of EU; lawyers were gitty about it.
      - The US tried to dig around to find out what Max Schrems would say the next day in court, by calling his friends one by one.
      - Max Schrems won.
      - Safe harbor was made illegal overnight.
      - Facebook's data handling through PRISM was "in essence illegal" -- meaning it was horribly, badly illegal.
- Outcome.
  - Now any third-party (non-EU) country's has to have data protection on an _equivalent level_, instead of _adequate_.
  - All Safe harbor-allowed companies have been revoked.
    - Now companies have to ask for informed, unambigious, free choice consent to data storage. This includes mentioning "sending data to NSA, FBI, ..."
  - Standard contractual clauses/BCRs.
    - Question about "factual" or "abstract/law" level checks.
    - Hotel bookings are still legal, because the data is needed to perform the service on location, for example in New York.
    - Irish DPC now has more information.
      - Even though full information about how Facebook uses data is required by EU law, Facebook won't divulge how user data is used.
- "Safe harbor 2.0"
  - US data protection has to be "equivalent" of EU data protection.
- Future.
  - Massive problems for "PRISM" companies.
  - Serious problems for business subject to US surveillance laws.
- EU surveillance.
  - Charter of fundamental rights doesn't cover EU countries surveillance.
