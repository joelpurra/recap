# Hacking EU funding for a decentralizing FOSS project

*Understanding and adapting EU legal guidelines from a FOSS perspective*

*FOSS and hacker culture meeting the EU buereaucracy. What can possibly come out of that? We'll discuss what is involved for FOSS projects and other interested parties to get $$$ funding by the European Union. Hackers deal with rule systems and their execution. And the European Union issues a lot of rules which are executed by the "commission" and its employees. Within the Horizon2020 framework programme 80.000.000.000 Euros will be distributed towards research projects across Europe between 2014-2020. Shouldn't some of that money go to purposes deemed useful by 32c3 attendants?*
