- Lessons learned
  # Come early to the table.
    - Look at what will be happening in three years.
    - Put your suggestions in early.
  # Provide actionable items.
    - Both to users and MEPs.
    - Faxes, calls, emails.

  # Be clear about your demands.
      - Ask for something realistic.
      - First reading text was fine.
        - Needs simple majority.
      - Second reading was tough.
        - Need absolute majority.
    - TSM agreement was done at 2AM.
      - Some groups had already left.
      - The president (?) of the meeting was already heading out the door when an agreement was reached.
    - Ask yourself "is this text worse than useless?"
      - Would an EU law improve the situation in at least some countries?
      - Are there drawbacks?
    - There was support from the US, famous thinkers, internet companies, venture capitalists.
      - Support came in late -- should have been done when it was not as urgent.
  # Broaden your movement.
