# The state of Internet Censorship

Will Scott, andz@torproject.org

*The techniques to control access to the Internet, and the ability to bring transparency to those processes are both continuing to evolve. Weâ€™ll give an update on the landscape of online information controls, and our ability to measure them.*

- China's great cannon; DDOS with javascript.

	- Some groups classify reports.
	- OpenNet Initiative measures censorship, but doesn't publish data as it could be used to find those who measure.
	- ooni is a measuement platform.
		- Send multiple requests, over the open internet and for example Tor. This can detect differences.
		- Raspberry Pi image available, to increase number of endpoints.
	- ICLabs does work.
	- RIPE has an atlas of network coverage.
- Centralized measurements
	- Lots of Tor users spike in Bangladesh during Facebook blocking.

	- Informed consent?
	- US Homeland Security's the Menlo Report discusses ethics in internet measurement.
